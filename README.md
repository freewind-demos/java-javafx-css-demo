JavaFX Css Demo
===============

We have two ways:

1. `Node.setStyle("-fx-background-color: GREEN")` with inline styles
2. `Node.getStylesheets().add("hello.css")` to load css files, which has css classes defined

We can't define css classes in Java code directly, they have to be in some real file.
